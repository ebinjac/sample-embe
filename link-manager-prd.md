# Link Manager - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Executive Summary

The Link Manager is a centralized repository designed to organize, categorize, and manage operational links across teams. This tool addresses the critical need for teams to maintain a single source of truth for all operational links, tagged to specific applications, with configurable visibility controls and efficient bulk operations.

## 2. Problem Statement

Operations teams currently struggle with:
